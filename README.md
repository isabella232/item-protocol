# Item protocol

The Item protocol is supported on the Waves blockchain by convention. Namely speaking it is a set of rules and transaction format restrictions. There is no specific capabilities or checks for an item format on Waves blockchain itself. Items protocol convention is a subject to change. For now it operates with version 1. Waves team will put their best efforts to provide backward compatibility is case of future changes.

For more information on how it works, check out the [Item protocol specification](./specification.md)
